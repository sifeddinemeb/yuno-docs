# Yuno Master Guide

## Project Overview

Yuno is "The Internet's Human Intelligence Layer" - a revolutionary human verification system that replaces traditional CAPTCHAs with engaging cognitive micro-challenges. The platform simultaneously verifies human users, trains AI models with high-quality data, and provides superior bot detection.
