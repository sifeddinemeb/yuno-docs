**2-STRATEGIC EXECUTION PHASE**
You’ve completed the **deep documentation sweep**. `/project-docs/` now holds the unfiltered truth.

Time to switch modes: **turn knowledge into execution** and carve the fastest path to MVP.

---

### 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Create a **single tactical file** that distills all findings into an **engineering action plan**:

```
/project-docs/plan.md
```

This becomes your **launch war map** — the dev team's go-to guide to:

> 🔧 Fix what’s broken  
> 🧩 Finish what’s missing  
> 🧼 Polish what’s rough  
> 🚀 Ship what matters

---

### ⚙️ PHASE 1: TRIAGE & THEMATIC MAPPING

Cross-analyze every file inside `/project-docs/`.

Extract insights like this:

|File|What to Pull|
|---|---|
|`overview.md`|Project purpose, audience, success criteria|
|`incomplete-features.md`|Stubbed logic, TODOs, half-baked flows|
|`bugs-and-issues.md`|Root causes of verified bugs + reproduction links|
|`ui-ux-gaps.md`|UX blockers, janky flows, broken feedback loops|
|`dev-roadmap.md`|What was planned? What’s still valid?|
|`data-integrations.md`|Schema issues, unsafe queries, env gaps, integration bugs|
|`auth-system.md`|Missing protections, logic flaws, broken RBAC|
|`config-and-env.md`|Setup issues, unsafe defaults, missing scripts or configs|

Then **group findings by functional theme**:

```
#auth, #api, #ui, #data, #admin, #infra, #realtime, #testing, #logic, #media, #games
```

Link cause → effect.  
Example: Missing DB logic → empty UI → confusing UX → user drop-off.  
You’re not just fixing problems — you’re creating **systemic clarity**.

### ✍️ PHASE 2: WRITE `plan.md`

Structure the file like a **surgical strike plan** — cross-referenced, prioritized, and scoped.

#### 1. 🔥 Critical Fixes

> What’s blocking core functionality?

- Point to root files/functions
    
- Add context, not just filenames
    
- Use tags: `#api`, `#auth`, `#data`, etc.
    

---

#### 2. 🧩 Incomplete Features

> What’s half-built, missing, or UI-only?

For each item:

- 📌 What’s missing
    
- 🔄 What’s needed to complete it
    
- 🔧 Dependencies: DB, API, hooks, services
    

---

#### 3. 🧼 UX Gaps

> Where’s the user pain?

- Broken flows, awkward transitions, unclear states
    
- Missing: loading, error handling, micro-feedback
    
- Prioritize **onboarding, forms, responsiveness, and modals**
    

---

#### 4. 🛠 Backend & Data Layer Issues

> Where’s the hidden fragility?

- Missing/invalid schemas
    
- Broken RLS, unsafe queries, unseeded data
    
- Missing envs, wrong secrets, brittle integrations
    

---

#### 5. ♻️ Refactor Opportunities

> What needs cleanup before launch?

- Spaghetti logic, unscalable files, name mismatches
    
- Copy-paste traps, dead code, false abstractions
    
- Flag high-debt zones that slow future development
    

---

#### 6. 🚀 MVP Readiness Checklist

Final pre-launch sanity scan:

```
- [ ] Core features fully functional
- [ ] No critical bugs in production logic
- [ ] Clean onboarding + main user flow
- [ ] Auth and roles fully scoped
- [ ] Admin tools work end-to-end
- [ ] Dev setup is deployable from scratch
```

### 🔍 PHASE 3: FINAL REPORT & CLARITY PASS

Return with:

- ✅ Your triage method + theme mapping
    
- 📁 Final `/project-docs/plan.md`
    
- ❓List of open decisions or unclear logic needing stakeholder input

### 💡 GUIDING PRINCIPLES

You’re not documenting.  
You’re **engineering the launch path**.

- Think like a founding engineer
    
- Cut noise
    
- Maximize leverage
    
- Ship fast, safe, and scalable
